Summary of DriverPass Project:
  For this project, I was assigned a simulated client that wished to have a system designed for their use.  The client in this project is DriverPass, which is a business 
  that provides online and in person driving training and education.  Through an interview transcript, I learned that the client wanted a system that could provide online 
  courses for students, maintain and organize crucial data for the business, allow offline functionality, and overall provide additional ease of practice for providing driving
  education services.  

If I could choose one part of my work in the documents to revise, it would be the use case diagram.  For my diagram I took a more generalized approach, and I would choose to take
a more specific approach, and perhaps spend a day brainstorming different ways to interact with the system, to provide a more holistic view of the system.

I interpreted the user's needs as primarily needing the students to have access to their individual student pages only, which would have all of the things that they  need to access for their
education.  On the back end of the system, the administrators and secrataries would need to have more access than students, to edit student profiles, set appointments, and change information
displayed on the system.  It is important to consider the needs of each user when designing beause the users will be relying on this system to make their tasks easier, rather than harder.  Hindering the
tasks of a user would make the system redundant, if not bothersome.  The intent of the system is to aid in the users ability to complete a task, which is why it is so important to have a full 
understanding of all the tasks that the users will need to complete.

In my approach to designing software, I want to first get an understanding of what the client wants, what they will need, and what tasks will be performed by the users when interacting with the software.  Once
I am confident that I know what the client will be using the software for, and what their needs will be, I then try to brainstorm the specific requirements to get them recorded, then brainstorm the different ways
that the users would interact with the system, and try to find ways to make those interactions more user friendly, secure, efficient, or reliable.  In the future, I would like to take more time on the brainstorming step, 
so that if I think of other perspectives throught a longer period, I can add those perspectives to my design, and include a more detailed view of the system as a whole.
